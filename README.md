# learnfastapi
Just a demo project to learn fastapi to perform basic CRUD

Thoughts:-
1. The lack of syntactic sugar was welcome but it does take time to know where we use classes and objects
2. Installed DB Browser for SQLLite on my Windows machine. Not bad if you want to see how the .db file looks
3. CRUD was pretty straightforward but not a fan of orm. It adds more complexity than one would like
4. Being a SQL guy, need to find a way to make use of those skills instead of remembering the ToDo class is a table and todo is an object
5. This mini effort was courtesy of the tutorial at [here](https://www.gormanalysis.com/blog/building-a-simple-crud-application-with-fastapi)
6. Didn't refactor the code further because the lack of wielding SQL for doing something simple was getting incovenient
